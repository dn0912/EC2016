Task 1 – Misc. (10+10+10 = 30%) 
a) Explain with your own words how distributed storage engines (like Dynamo) is handling temporary failures and give an example.  

  - Technique: "Sloppy Quorum" and hinted handoff
  - these techniques provide high availability and durability guarantee when some of the replicas are not available
  - all read and write operations are performed on the frist N healthy nodes from the preference list, which may not always be the first N nodes encountered while walking the consistens hashing ring
  - with a example DynamoDB configuration of N=3 and a temporary failure occurs or a write operation is happening on node A, a replica that would normally have lived in A will now be sent to node D. The replica will have a hint in its metadata with a suggestion to the node which was intended - A. The hints are kept in a separate local databse that is scanned periodically. If A is available again, D will attempt to deliver the replica to A. After the transfer, D may delete the object from its local store

b) Give a reasons why one should use distributed caching and explain it in a use case.

  - distributed cache can be bigger in cache size, it combines resources from several servers
  - distributed cache can reduce the cost of lookups across all the servers in the cluster, because distributed cache provides an architecture where all the hosts are sharing the load of answering reads requests
  - distributed cache limits the interruption to typical operations during optimization and maintenance activities, so performance-enhancing tools dont break continous operations and performance tanking is avoided


c) Name three advantages of distributed caches and explain them in one sentence. 


Task 2 – GFS (20+10+10 = 40%) 
a) Which operations are supported by GFS? For which types of queries is GFS optimized?  


b) State two main differences between Dynamo and GFS with regard to operation and 
data types? 


c) Explain why GFS is particularly well suited as storage system for MapReduce job input 
and output data (why not Dynamo or a relational database?). 


Task 3 –BigTable (20+10=30%) 
a) Please describe in your own words how the BigTable storage engine works by explain-
ing the steps of a write request, and a read request, respectively (local persistence).


b) True or False: Bigtable provides additional security, geo-distribution and support for big 
files. If False, shortly explain.
